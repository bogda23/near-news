# near-news
Learn the news from around you and share them with your family and friends.
Considering the troubled time in which we live in we need to have a reliable source of news based on our own location.
What I'm trying to do here is to inspire the news companies to not only focus on the bad side of thinks but to think to the day to day life of the people
and let them be happy.
Feeding peaople with bad stories and news is toxic, my goal is to avoid toxicity as much as posible.
